The file "datasets/trump_tweets.txt" is a text file and does not contain any code. It should contain the dataset of Donald Trump's tweets. Here is a mockup of how the data might be structured:

```
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade, Military and everything else! Excellent call, wished him congrats!
Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
```

Please note that this is just a mockup and the actual data should be collected from a reliable source.
