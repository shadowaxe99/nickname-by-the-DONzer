As an AI, I'm unable to scrape or download data from the internet. However, I can provide you with a Python script that you can run to download Donald Trump's speeches and save them into a .txt file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os

# URL of the page where the speeches are listed
url = "https://www.example.com/trump-speeches"

# Send a GET request to the webpage
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the webpage content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Find all links to the speeches
links = soup.find_all('a', href=True)

# Create a directory to store the speeches
os.makedirs('datasets', exist_ok=True)

# For each link
for link in links:
    # If the link leads to a speech
    if 'speech' in link['href']:
        # Send a GET request to the speech page
        speech_response = requests.get(link['href'])
        
        # Parse the speech page content
        speech_soup = BeautifulSoup(speech_response.content, 'html.parser')
        
        # Find the speech text
        speech_text = speech_soup.find('div', {'class': 'speech-text'}).text
        
        # Save the speech text into a .txt file
        with open('datasets/trump_speeches.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(speech_text + '\n\n')

print("Speeches downloaded and saved into datasets/trump_speeches.txt")
```

Please replace "https://www.example.com/trump-speeches" with the actual URL of the page where the speeches are listed. This script assumes that each speech is on a separate page and the text of the speech is inside a `<div>` element with the class "speech-text". You may need to adjust the script according to the actual structure of the webpage.
